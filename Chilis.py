# that many copies of the previous message. (Hint: order of operations exists in Python)
# Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines. (Hint: the string

# 3. Take a list, say for example this one:
#
#   a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
# and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.
#
# Extras:
#
# Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the
# elements less than 5 from this list in it and print out this new list.
# Write this in one line of Python.
# Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements from
# the original list a that are smaller than that number given by the user.

# 4. Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number.
# (If you don’t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number.
# For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

#   b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
# and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists
# (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.
#
# Extras:
#
# Randomly generate two lists to test this
# Write this in one line of Python (don’t worry if you can’t figure this out at this point - we’ll get to it soon)

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

# 6. Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not.
# (A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.)

if word == word[::-1]:
    print('The provided word is a palindrome.')
else:
    print('The provided word is  not a palindrome.')
#
# 7. Let’s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100].
# Write one line of Python that takes this list a
# and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.

#
#
# 9.Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9).
# Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right.
# (Hint: remember to use the user input lessons from the very first exercise)
#
# Extras:
#
# Keep the game going until the user types “exit”
# Keep track of how many guesses the user has taken, and when the game ends, print this out.
